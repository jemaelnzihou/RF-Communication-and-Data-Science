# Traditional Network vs. Cloud Infrastructure

![Topology Overview](https://github.com/jemaelnzihou/RF-Communication-and-Data-Science/blob/main/images/network-diagram.png) <!-- Update this image path if needed -->

## 📘 Overview

This project offers a comparative exploration of traditional enterprise network architectures and their modern cloud-based counterparts. It bridges foundational networking concepts—like ARP, routing, and switching—with cloud-native tools such as VPC routing tables, security groups, and elastic IPs.

## 🔍 What's Inside

- **Layer-by-layer topology breakdown**
- **ARP & MAC resolution in real-world scenarios**
- **Packet journey mapping from client to server**
- **Bandwidth-Delay Product (BDP), TCP throughput, and queuing models**
- **Security mapping: ACLs vs. Security Groups**
- **Troubleshooting & cloud migration strategy**

## 📊 Mathematical Models

The PDF explores core network performance models:
- **BDP (Bandwidth-Delay Product)**: `BDP = Bandwidth × RTT`
- **TCP Throughput Formula**:  
  `Throughput = (MSS / RTT) × (1 / √(2p/3))`
- **Queuing Delay**: `Delay = (L × N) / R`

These are essential for understanding latency, performance bottlenecks, and cloud capacity planning.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

As more infrastructures shift to the cloud, understanding how traditional models map to cloud equivalents (e.g., ENIs, routing tables) is vital for:
- Cloud architects
- Network engineers
- Data scientists working in hybrid environments
- Students preparing for CCNA or AWS certifications

This guide also supports Zero Trust designs, autoscaling models, and real-time debugging.
