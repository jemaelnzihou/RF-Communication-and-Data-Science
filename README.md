RF Communication &amp; Wi-Fi Optimization: Simulate QPSK, model BER vs. SNR, visualize exponential backoff, and optimize Wi-Fi access using Python &amp; data science tools.

# üì° Wi-Fi Optimization and RF Communication Protocols with Data Science

This project explores RF (Radio Frequency) communication techniques and protocol-level optimizations using data science tools. 
Using simulations in Python and visualizations via Jupyter Notebook, we examine the key components of wireless communication‚Äîfrom modulation techniques like QPSK to MAC-level protocols such as exponential backoff.
